The code was originally developed by Junxing Zheng  (Sep. 2014),

Please check the LICENSE.md file for the original license.

The original code was written in MATLAB by Junxing Zheng. This is a Python version. It is not a line by line conversion, however, most of the original logic has been preserved. This is a preliminary version, need some more work.

If you use this, you are on your own, I am not better than you in programming or in Python. If you make interesting changes or improve the code please let me know.

The code was developed using Python 3.6 with the Anaconda distribution.
